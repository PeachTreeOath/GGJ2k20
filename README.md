# Repair Royale

Repair Royale is an robot arena auto chess game, leveraging [Air Console](https://www.airconsole.com/) for controller input.

Players use their time in "Buy Rounds" spending their money on repairs and weapon selections. Rounds begin by releasing player's AI driven bots into an arena. Bots shoot projectiles and collide with melee weapons, causing damage and knock back.

As rounds process, the arena's walls will lower, allowing bots to fall off. The last player on the arena wins that round.

This game was created at Global Game Jam 2020.

> The Global Game Jam (GGJ) is an annual distributed game jam. Bringing together the elements of creativity, collaboration and experimentation. At each site, participants gather to develop ideas, form small groups, create new, creative, innovative games, and present them to their peers and the global community, all in a limited time span. In January 2019, GGJ generated teams in 860 sites in 113 countries, who over the course of one weekend created 9,010 games.
